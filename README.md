## AI-powered-CI-CD


# Overview
This project demonstrates an AI-powered Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline built with Go. The application includes a simple machine learning model (k-NN classifier using the Iris dataset) exposed via a REST API, automated testing, building, and deployment using GitHub Actions. The pipeline containerizes the application with Docker and deploys it to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).
